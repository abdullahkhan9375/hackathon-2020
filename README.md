# Hackathon-2020 
Mobile Web-App UI with a functional chatbot made for the MQ Big Data Society Hackathon.

## Motivation
Our team wanted to make a UI interface that captured an elegant front page for a mobile banking app. We wanted to incorporate new and unique features such as a live dashboard, 
widgets and live subscriptions linked to the bank account. 

## Code Style
Majority of the project is in HTML / CSS as it was supposed to be a demo project. I have used custom CSS and no external frameworks. 

## Tech/Framework used
- HTML 5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- Plotly.js (for graphing)
- Netlify for deployment

## Features
- A live graph with dummy income/expense data. Fully interactable.
- IBM Watson chatbot integration. 
- Dark Mode
- Incorporates modern Glass Morphism design. 

## Important Note
As of 19/12/2020, this project is only compatible with mobile browsers as it was designed with a mobile-first (and only mobile) approach. Kindly visit the url from your mobile phone.
